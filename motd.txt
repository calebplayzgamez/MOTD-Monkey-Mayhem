This is official. I am going to discontinue Monkey Adventure's. I'll go over why I am doing this and the future for Monkey Adventure's. Ever since I started this project I've worked on it nonstop for 5 months, it's caused me so much stress having to worry about updating the game and releasing patches for the game. Don't get me wrong now I also liked the game a lot I loved playing the game with all you. But the game is mentally killing me from the inside and I having so much depression and suicidal thought's on myself because of the game, I hope you will understand me and respect me for making this choice. Now for the future of the game I will keep the PlayFab, Photon, and the game's Unity project, There will just be no public server's for anyone, and no updates. Now it could be possible that way into the future I will continue the game but that's a maybe. Thank you all for the support and love towards the game it did make me feel very happy at time's, If you want to still follow me and be updated on the stuff I do then you can join the Discord server and go to my account and follow my TikTok and YouTube. The Monkey Mayhem's server will go down tomorrow at 1 PM CST.
