I've spent 4 and a half month's working on this game making it fun. When released it people started getting out the map telling everyone how to, telling everyone what's outside the map. People say I copied Capuchin which I clear didn't because the game looks nothing liked Capuchin and I even put credits of Capuchin in credit's for inspiration. I am disapointed I make a amazing game and this is what I get. Anyone who get's caught and reported for getting out the map gets a 4 week ban. If you keep doing it I will permanently ban.
